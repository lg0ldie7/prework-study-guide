# <Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide>

## Description

I created this project to learn the fundamentals of coding to better prepare myself for the next few months to come knowing this is a full time fully immersive bootcamp.
This project has taught me how to use the command line, HTML, CSS, and the building blocks to further explore Javascript. Through building this web application I also downloaded all the necessary software I need for more course.

The Prework Study Guide was made for the use of anyone new to coding bootcamp, or just anyone that is interested in learning the basics to getting started. Each section contains notes about a certain topic like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Use the DevTools console and see the JavaScript running. Use it to see it list topics we learned in prework, and let it choose one topic for you to study first.
